# _Zoo Tracker_

#### _App to track a zoo's animals, 06.09.17_

#### By _**E. Baharie**_

## Description

_The idea for this app is to create a program to record the details of care for a zoo's animals. This will include diet, age, which will be a filtered category for old and young, and location for efficiency of care. I would like to add the animal's image at some point in order to help new or temporary caretakers. Also being able to back up the record to Firebase would be nice._

## Planning
* _I will nee to setup my dependencies clearly for ease of use_
* _I need an animal obj to record all details_
* _I will want a clean uniform ui._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_
